# Astronomer Messaging, Positioning, and Proof Points

Use this file when building sales, customer-facing, or external decks. Pull stats, narratives,
and customer proof from here rather than making things up.

## Core Positioning

**One-liner:** Unified orchestration. The fastest path to trusted data and production AI.

**Company narrative:** Astronomer is the commercial platform for Apache Airflow. We've moved
from "managed Airflow" to "the data engineering company" — the platform that powers the
context layer enterprises need to run AI in production.

**Three product pillars:**
- **BUILD** — Ship faster with AI-native developer tools
- **RUN** — Reliable, performant, enterprise-grade execution
- **OBSERVE** — Full lineage, alerting, data quality, and cost control

**Astro Engine differentiators (vs. MWAA and GCC):**
- 2x parallel load per worker (pipelines stay reliable under spikes)
- 30%+ more DAG runs for the same spend
- 3-4x faster task starts (fresher data, faster)
- 10x delivery speed with AI-driven developer tools
- Intelligent auto-scaling of task-optimized workers
- Faster RCA with built-in lineage, asset catalog, and AI log summaries

## Key Industry Stats (cite sources when using in decks)

| Stat | Source |
|------|--------|
| 95% of GenAI pilots fail at achieving measurable AI, often stalling before production | MIT Report, 2025 |
| 32% of Airflow users have GenAI or MLOps use cases in production | Astronomer survey |
| 62% of Astro customers have GenAI/MLOps in production (vs. 32% industry avg.) | Astronomer data |
| 80% of Airflow users are turning to AI to address productivity challenges — only 9% are satisfied | Astronomer survey |
| 46% of organizations say Airflow problems halt their entire operation | Astronomer survey |
| Apache Airflow: 30M monthly downloads, 3K contributors | Apache Foundation |
| 100% of Airflow releases driven by Astronomer | Astronomer |

## Competitive Benchmarks (vs. MWAA and GCC)

From internal benchmarking study (Astro vs. GCC vs. MWAA):

- **Max concurrency (Astro Executor): 22** vs. GCC: 11, MWAA: 15, Astro+Celery: 17
- **Workers needed for same workload:** MWAA: 9, GCP: 5, Astro+Celery: 4, Astro+Astro: 5
- Astro Executor handles **double the GCC workload** and **20x the MWAA workload** at max scale
- **85%+ reduction in DAG failures** from Redis faults vs. Celery on OSS/GCC/MWAA
- Astro delivers **30% more DAG runs per dollar** than alternatives at comparable price points
- Concurrency tuning on GCC and MWAA is brittle — Astro has wide tolerance ranges, much more forgiving

Key message: Astro is the most reliable AND most scalable option. MWAA is cheapest at tiny
scale but breaks down under load. GCC caps out early. Astro scales without sharding.

## Customer Proof Points

### Autodesk
- **Challenge:** Fragmented environments, complex PII handling across disparate pipelines (Oozie)
- **Solution:** Standardized orchestration, rapid test environment setup, governance, multi-tenancy, CI/CD
- **Results:** 33% faster deployment cycles, 60% reduction in tech debt, 90% data quality increase
- **Quote:** "This success wouldn't have been possible without the powerful capabilities of Astronomer." — Bhavesh Jaisinghani, Data Engineering Manager

### Apache Airflow ecosystem (proof of market)
Uber, Stripe, Apple, OpenAI/ChatGPT, Ford, Wix, Robinhood, Anthropic, LinkedIn, GitHub Copilot, Bloomberg, Notion — all running critical workflows on Airflow.

### Trusted by (Astro customers)
Northern Trust, Adobe, DataStax, Foot Locker, T. Rowe Price, Activision, Autodesk

## Narrative Arcs (for structuring decks)

These are the core perception shifts Astronomer drives in customer conversations.

### 1. The AI production problem
- **Before:** 95% of GenAI pilots fail. Teams build experiments, not production systems.
- **After:** Orchestration is the missing layer. It turns AI experiments into production outcomes.
- **Use for:** Executive/economic buyer decks, AI-focused pitches

### 2. Unified control plane
- **Before:** Teams run analytics, ML, and AI on separate platforms with different operating models.
- **After:** One orchestration layer unifies all data and AI workflows. Fewer tools, faster delivery.
- **Use for:** Platform consolidation deals, expansion conversations

### 3. Legacy migration (LegMod)
- **Before:** Migrating off our legacy scheduler feels like a risky, multi-year project.
- **After:** Airflow + Astro is the neutral layer that lets you run anywhere, lock into nothing.
- **Use for:** Displacement of Control-M, Informatica, cron, MWAA, GCC

### 4. Enterprise reliability
- **Before:** Pipeline failures cascade into missed SLAs and lost revenue. We have no DR.
- **After:** Astro delivers HA/DR built in. Pipelines stay running even during infrastructure disruptions.
- **Use for:** Enterprise procurement, security-first accounts, financial services

### 5. AI-native development
- **Before:** Generic AI tools give marginal gains. Manual work still dominates.
- **After:** The entire pipeline lifecycle — dev to monitoring to remediation — is enhanced by AI that understands your specific environment.
- **Use for:** Data engineering teams evaluating developer productivity tools

## Key Personas

| Persona | What they care about | How to speak to them |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Data engineer | Reliability, developer experience, not getting paged at 2am | Technical, specific, outcome-focused. Show you understand Airflow deeply. |
| Platform / data platform team | Governance, cost control, enterprise-wide standards | Unified control plane, security, observability, scalability. |
| VP/Director of Data (economic buyer) | AI strategy, time to value, competitive pressure | Business outcomes, ROI, risk reduction. Use the stat-heavy slides. |

## What to Avoid in Copy

- No em dashes. Use periods or commas.
- No "leverage," "synergize," "best-in-class," "world-class," "game-changing."
- Don't say "managed Airflow" — say "commercial Airflow platform" or "the data engineering company."
- Don't say "Astronomer provides" — say "Astro" or be direct about the outcome.
- Avoid passive voice in headers.
